# Simple webpack integration example

This is a simple example to use Uploader Window with webpack.

## To view the demo

### First clone the repository on your computer

`git clone https://github.com/uploader-window/webpack.git`

### Then inside the newly created directory, type the following command

`cd webpack`
`yarn install`

### Then run the dev server by typing the following:

`yarn run start`

### Finally build the example by typing the following:

`yarn run build`

(This will create a dist folder with the example)


### Notes

- You can use `npm` instead of `yarn` too (just type `npm` instead of the word `yarn` in the examples above)
- To modify the source, view the `index.js` file in `src` directory
